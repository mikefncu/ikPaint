What is ikPaint?
================

ikPaint is a (light?) modified version of KDE KolourPaint (http://www.kolourpaint.org) compiled for macOS. ikPaint removes all KDE dependencies of KolourPaint and it is compiled using only Qt 5 libraries. Some features from the original software were excluded and few new options were added.

Like KolourPaint, ikPaint is a free, easy-to-use paint program.

It aims to be conceptually simple to understand; providing a level of
functionality targeted towards the average user.  It's designed for daily
tasks like:

* Painting - drawing diagrams and "finger painting"
* Image Manipulation - editing screenshots and photos; applying effects
* Icon Editing - drawing clipart and logos with transparency

It's not an unusable and monolithic program where simple tasks like drawing
lines become near impossible.  Nor is it so simple that it lacks essential
features like Undo/Redo.

ikPaint is opensource software written in C++ using only the Qt libraries.
